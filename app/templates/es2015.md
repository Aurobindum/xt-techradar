## Description

ES2015 (formally ES6) is a fantastic step forward for the JavaScript language. It brings new features and sugaring for patterns that required significant boilerplate in ES5. This includes classes, arrow functions and modules. In this episode, we cover tools we use to take full advantage of ES2015 when building JavaScript web-apps.
